For this application, transactions will be stored and manipulated using a nested list data structure. 
Each transaction will be represented as a sublist containing the following elements:

 Amount: Float value converted into String value with two decimal points representing the transaction amount.
 Category: String representing the category of the transaction.
 Type: String representing the type of transaction (Income or Expense).
 Date: String representing the date of the transaction (formatted as 'yyyy-mm-dd').

The overall data structure will be a list of transactions, where each transaction is represented as a sublist.

    [["1320.75", "Bonus", "Income", "2024-1-25"],["150.50", "Lunch", "Expense", "2024-1-18"]]

Each sublist represents a single transaction.

 The first element of each sublist is the transaction amount.
 The second element is the transaction category.
 The third element is the transaction type.
 The fourth element is the transaction date.

This design allows for easy manipulation and management of transactions. 
For example, adding a new transaction involves appending a new sublist to the transactions list. 
For updating or deleting a transaction involves modifying or removing the corresponding sublist. 
Additionally, iterating through the transactions list allows for generating summaries, displaying transactions.
